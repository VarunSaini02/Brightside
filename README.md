Mr. Brightside was by far the biggest focus of the first nine weeks of our iOS class. Together, Blake and I worked on Mr. Brightside, which is essentially an alarm app. Our goal was to create an alarm app that didn't have to be running in the background to play notifications. Additionally, we wanted our app to play an entire song when the time came, which was difficult because Apple only allows 30 second notification sounds. We overcame this issue by cutting up songs into 29.999 second clips and scheduling notifications at the appropriate times with the appropriate sound clips. Later on, we wanted to make a page to view which alarms were currently scheduled, which turned out to be quite difficult. With each alarm being made up of several different scheduled notifications, it became quite difficult to group notifications together into alarms and display them on a separate screen. This is where we left off, and we hope to keep perfecting this app as time passes. Attached below is an app we made along the way that demonstrates the scheduling of local notifications, which we had to familiarize ourselves with to make Mr. Brightside.
